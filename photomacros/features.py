Feature Generation Script

This script is designed to generate features from a dataset. Currently, the feature generation step
is placeholder and needs to be replaced with your own code. The script also includes basic logging functionality
to track the progress of the feature generation process.

Features:
- The ability to specify the input and output directories.
- Logs the start and completion of the feature generation process.
